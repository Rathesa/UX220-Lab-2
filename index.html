            Personally I am entertained and enthralled by the tension and thrill of Mystery novels. Being able to
            act as a detective and try to foresee the challenges or troubles the character faces and discover answers.

            Currently I am reading "The Beast Must Die By Nicholas Blake. Where a father plans the perfect
        murder that he will commit. The father Frank Cairns will be avenging the death of his son who
        was killed by a hit and run driver.  When he finds his victim, the victim is already deceased. 
        Now Cairns is looked as the suspect for a crime he did not do. Reading his journey has me glued to 
        to this book. I definitely recommend this book to any mystery lovers!
